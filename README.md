## About the application
Our application is called WikiGames and its aim is to reference
games by providing a range of useful information (such as the publisher, genres, game
game summary). We found the games using an online database and decided to keep only the ones we liked.
decided to keep just 20, but it is possible to add as many as you like without having to modify the code, as all the data is saved on Firebase. To make it easier to find your favourite video games, there's a
a 'favourites' function to keep them close at hand. You'll need to
create an account to use the application.
